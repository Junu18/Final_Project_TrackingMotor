2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock u_clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks
